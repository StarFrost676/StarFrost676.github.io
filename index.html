<h2>The passion Project</h2>

<p>My passion is learning about programming and coding!</p>

<p>I've learned so much already about HTML and CSS as I already know, theres more than HTML and CSS but right now I'm just learning about those 2 at the moment!</p>
<h3>I've been wondering...</h3>
<p>How long does it take to code a whole website?<br> I know that it takes a while but how long?</p>
<h3>I want to know...</h3>
<p> I want to know how to use c++ and more.<br> I want to be able to code websites and games!</p>
