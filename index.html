<h2>~The passion Project~</h2>

<h1>~My passion is learning about programming and coding!~</h1>
<p>~Sure, coding and programming may look complicated but, it's really easy depending on how you find it it could be complicated for you but not for me.~</p>
<p>~I've learned so much already about HTML and CSS as I already know, theres more than HTML and CSS but right now I'm just learning about those <strong>2 at the moment!~</strong></p>
   <p> <strong>~HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets~</strong></p>
<h3>~I've been wondering...~</h3>
<p>~How long does it take to code a whole website?~<br> ~I know that it takes a while but how long?~</p>
<h3>~I want to know...~</h3>
   <p> ~I want to know how to use <em>c++ and more</em>.~<br> ~I want to be able to code websites and games!~</p>
<p> ~I learned how to code this site that I'm pressenting on!~</p>
<a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" >~I used a website called GitHub to make this site!~</a>
   <p><strong>~Github</strong> is a cool wesite that lets you input a file and make it a website like this one but, the files have to be coded. I found about <strong>Github on Khan academy!~</strong>
